1. Add the following line to your hosts file (Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) to prevent
MDaemon from connecting to Alt-N.

127.13.37.127		services.altn.com
127.13.37.127		services.mdaemon.com

2. Start installation and continue as prompted.

3. Choose 'I already have a registration key'. You can use SSG's keygen to get a key, I'll use the one bellow.

Registration key: CXYLHEE-EQJHQEN-LIJGFEY

4. When you click next the installer tries to connect to Alt-N and verify you registration key.
Which obviously it can't and therefore gives you an error. At this point "Next >" button is disabled
and you cannot continue the installation process.

5. Run 'Windows Enabler' from Crack directory as *administrator*. It's a nice and little tool that allows
you to enable a disabled grayed out button for you. When you run it, it goes to system tray and by default
is not turned on. You need to click the tray icon to turn it on. When you turned it on, you just need to
click on the 'Next >' button and Windows Enabler changes the button to enabled state which in turn allows
you to continue the installation without Alt-N verifying your registration key. You can exit Windows Enabler now
by right clicking its tray icon and choosing Quit, since you won't be needing it anymore.

6. When installation is complete, uncheck 'Start MDaemon' and click 'Finish >'.

7. copy 'MDaemon' folder from Crack directory to 'C:\' and replace the files.

8. Copy 'LocalData.ini' from Crack directory to 'C:\MDaemon\LocalData'. Replace if there is already a file with that name.

9. Copy 'license.xml' to 'C:\MDaemon\License'.

10. Edit 'license.xml' and put your PCID in that file. You can find your PCID in 'license_request.xml'.

11. Now you can open start menu and start MDaemon.
