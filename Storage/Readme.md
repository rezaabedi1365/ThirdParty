![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78316f2f-f601-40d4-8d83-754c987fcce1)
### SAN
* Protocols
    - FC
    - iSCSI

* Key Characteristics of SANs:
    - Block-Level Access: SANs provide direct access to storage blocks, which is advantageous for applications requiring fast, low-latency data retrieval.
    - Performance: SANs are designed to meet the rigorous demands of enterprise-level applications, ensuring reliable and high-speed data access.
    - Scalability: SANs offer greater scalability by connecting multiple storage devices, making them suitable for businesses with expanding storage needs.
    
### NAS:
* Protocols
    - SMB
    - CIFS
    - NFS

* Key Characteristics of
    - File-Level Access: NAS provides file-level access, ideal for environments where collaborative work and content sharing are paramount.
    - Simplicity: NAS solutions offer straightforward setups and intuitive interfaces, making them accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
    - Scalability: While NAS devices can be expanded by adding more drives, there may be limitations in terms of performance and scalability for large-scale enterprise use.
